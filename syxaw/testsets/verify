# Set of tests that (eventually will) form a comprehensive
# test of Syxaw functionality. The test order in this file
# is from basic towards more advanced functionality. Generally,
# each test relies on functionality verified by previous tests
# (and, hence, does not re-verify that functionality) .
# However, each test is also self contained in that it may be executed
# independetly of any other test. In case of failure, however,
# it is better to use the full test set to pinpoint the fault.
