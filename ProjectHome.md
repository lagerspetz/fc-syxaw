Syxaw is file synchronizer targeted for weakly connected and
power-constrained devices, such as a mobile phone. It features a
simple sharing model based on "linking" objects, optimized network transport by use of batching and deltas, and has support for merging concurrent changes.

Syxaw was developed in the Fuego Core project at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology.
